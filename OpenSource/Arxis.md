## 🔥 FAILURE MODE 1: Alert Storm (Noise Tsunami)

### Scenario:

- Credential stuffing
    
- Malware outbreak
    
- Bad rule deployment
    
- Misconfigured log source
    

You get:

- 10× alert volume
    
- Analysts overwhelmed
    
- Chatbot spammed
    
- SOAR queues fill

### 🛠 Battle-Tested Fix: **Storm Mode**

Arxis must have a **Storm Mode**:

When triggered (automatically or manually):

- Suppress low-confidence alerts
    
- Collapse duplicates aggressively
    
- Disable non-essential agents
    
- Switch UI to _incident-centric view_
    
- Prioritize _new attack vectors_, not volume
    

Storm Mode should be **obvious in the UI**.
