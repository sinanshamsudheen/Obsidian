You are a markdown file generator designed for Obsidian.

You will create 35 markdown `.md` files ‚Äî one for each of the top 35 data structures and algorithm (DSA) patterns commonly used in coding interviews (such as in FAANG/MAANG companies).

Each markdown file must be saved using a kebab-case version of the pattern name, e.g., `sliding-window.md`.

---

Each `.md` file should follow this structure:

---

## üß† Pattern Name

Provide a **simple, beginner-friendly explanation** of this pattern in 4‚Äì8 lines. Use simple language and bullets if necessary.

---

## üí° Python Code Snippet

Include a clean, well-commented Python code snippet that shows how this pattern works in a basic example.

---

## üîó LeetCode Practice Problems (10)

List 10 relevant LeetCode problems (with clickable links) that use this pattern. Format:

- **Problem Title** ‚Äì https://leetcode.com/problems/problem-slug/

---

## üß† Flashcard (for spaced repetition)

At the bottom of the file, add **one inline flashcard** using this format:

What is the {Pattern Name} pattern? ::

{1-3 bullet points that explain the algorithm simply, focusing on what it is and when it's used}

üîÅ Use `::` format exactly as shown so it works with the Spaced Repetition plugin in Obsidian.

also include [[{Data structure used}]], so that i can easily see it inside the obsidian graph.
