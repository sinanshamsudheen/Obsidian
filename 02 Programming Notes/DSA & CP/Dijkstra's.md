### Concrete Example  
Explain how the solution works with a sample input/output.

```python
# Example solution
import heapq

def dijkstra(graph, start):
    n = len(graph)
    dist = [float('inf')] * n
    dist[start] = 0

    pq = [(0, start)]  # (distance, node)

    while pq:
        d, u = heapq.heappop(pq)

        if d > dist[u]:
            continue  # Already found a better path

        for v, weight in graph[u]:
            if dist[u] + weight < dist[v]:
                dist[v] = dist[u] + weight
                heapq.heappush(pq, (dist[v], v))

    return dist

# -----------------------------
# Step 1: Take input from user
# -----------------------------

n, m = map(int, input("Enter number of nodes and edges: ").split())
graph = [[] for _ in range(n)]

print("Enter each edge in format: u v w")
print("(0-indexed, undirected graph)")

for _ in range(m):
    u, v, w = map(int, input().split())
    graph[u].append((v, w))
    graph[v].append((u, w))  # Remove this for directed graph

# -----------------------------
# Step 2: Take source node
# -----------------------------

start = int(input("Enter source node: "))
distances = dijkstra(graph, start)

# -----------------------------
# Step 3: Print results
# -----------------------------

print(f"\nShortest distances from node {start}:")
for i, d in enumerate(distances):
    print(f"To node {i}: {d}")

```
