**Hey everyone!**
I’m **Sinan** from **Team Primum**, currently in my **4th semester** of **B.Tech in AI and ML Engineering** at **Sree Chitra Thirunal College of Engineering (SCT), Kerala**.

My journey into tech started during the **COVID lockdown**, when I developed a deep interest in **ethical hacking** and **cybersecurity**. I’d spend hours staring at unknown **terminals**, running **scripts**, scanning **ports** — just waiting for something exciting to happen. More often than not, I ended up breaking something by accident — in fact, I once completely messed up my **system software** and **bricked my laptop**. But those chaotic experiences sparked a genuine curiosity about how **systems work** and how they can be **secured**.

Eventually, I shifted focus to **machine learning**, and over the past several months, I’ve been learning **data science frameworks** and working on projects that exposed me to the full **ML pipeline** — from **data preprocessing** to **model tuning** to **deployment**. Two of my key projects include an **SVM-based image classifier** and a **Bangalore housing price prediction model**, both of which gave me hands-on experience with **feature engineering**, **evaluation**, and pushing models to production using **Flask** and **AWS**.

What excites me most about this internship is that it brings together both of my core interests — **AI** and **security**. I’m eager to explore how **machine learning** can be applied to solve real-world challenges like **anomaly detection**, **phishing classification**, and **secure log parsing**.

I’m currently diving into **deep learning**, and I’m planning to explore **natural language processing** next.

I’m really looking forward to learning from everyone at **TrustLab** and contributing meaningfully to the project. Thanks for having me!
