# SOC ML Handbook: Anomaly Detection using Isolation Forests + Session Entropy + Dependency Graphs

## ðŸ”¹ Section 1: Title & Problem Statement

### **Approach**: Anomaly Detection using Isolation Forests + Session Entropy + Dependency Graphs

### **Problem This Approach Solves**

This approach tackles the challenge of detecting novel, subtle, or evolving attack behaviors in enterprise environmentsâ€”particularly those sophisticated threats that slip past traditional rule-based intrusion detection systems. The model excels at identifying zero-day attacks, lateral movement, credential misuse, and privilege escalation attempts that don't match known attack signatures.

### **Why Traditional Methods Fail**

- **Signature Dependency**: Traditional systems rely on known attack signatures and statistical thresholds, making them blind to zero-day exploits and novel attack vectors
- **High False Positive Rate**: Dynamic, high-dimensional security data (user logins, API calls, process launches) overwhelms rule-based systems with noise
- **Lack of Behavioral Context**: Cannot distinguish between rare but legitimate activity (like a night-shift admin accessing critical systems) and genuine threats
- **Static Thresholds**: Fixed rules can't adapt to evolving user behaviors or business process changes

### **Why This ML Method is Preferred**

- **Unsupervised Learning**: No need for labeled attack dataâ€”crucial in real-world SOCs where most security events are unlabeled
- **Scalable & Efficient**: Handles high-dimensional, large-scale log data with minimal computational overhead
- **Robust to Noise**: Unlike clustering or density-based methods, Isolation Forest doesn't assume normal distributions and handles outliers gracefully
- **Contextual Awareness**: Session entropy and dependency graphs provide behavioral context that pure statistical methods miss

## ðŸ”¹ Section 2: Detailed Explanation of the Approach

### **Step-by-Step Breakdown**

#### **1. Data Ingestion & Preprocessing**

- **Real-time Stream Processing**: Kafka ingests authentication logs, process execution logs, and network traffic in real-time
- **Temporal Aggregation**: Raw events are grouped into time windows (e.g., hourly API call counts, daily login patterns)
- **Metadata Enrichment**: User profiles are enhanced with role information, typical work locations, and historical behavior patterns

#### **2. Feature Engineering: The Core Innovation**

**Session Entropy Calculation**:

- Measures behavioral randomness within user sessions
- **High Entropy**: May indicate lateral movement (attacker exploring unfamiliar systems) or credential misuse (automated tools)
- **Low Entropy**: Could suggest normal routine or potentially scripted legitimate automation
- **Formula**: `H(X) = -Î£ p(xi) * log2(p(xi))` where X represents actions within a session

**Dependency Graph Generation**:

- Creates network-like representations of relationships: user-to-system, process-to-process, system-to-system
- Represented as adjacency matrices for computational efficiency
- **Anomalous Patterns**: Unusual access paths, privilege escalation chains, or connections between typically isolated systems

#### **3. Isolation Forest Mechanism**

- **Core Principle**: Anomalies are easier to isolate than normal data points
- **Process**: Recursively partitions data using randomly selected features and split values
- **Key Insight**: Anomalies require fewer splits to isolate (shorter path lengths)
- **Configuration**: Typically uses 100 trees with max_samples=256 for optimal performance

#### **4. Dynamic Threshold Setting**

- Kernel density estimation adapts anomaly thresholds based on recent data distributions
- Prevents model degradation as normal behavior evolves over time

### **Real-World Significance**

**Session Entropy** helps detect:

- **Lateral Movement**: Attackers exploring systems they're unfamiliar with show higher entropy
- **Credential Stuffing**: Automated attacks often show unnaturally low entropy patterns
- **Insider Threats**: Deviation from an employee's typical behavioral patterns

**Dependency Graphs** reveal:

- **Privilege Escalation**: Unusual privilege elevation paths
- **Data Exfiltration Routes**: Abnormal data flow patterns toward external systems
- **Compromised Service Accounts**: Accounts accessing resources outside their normal scope

## ðŸ”¹ Section 3: Interview Q&A (SOC + ML)

### **Q1: Why is Isolation Forest particularly suitable for SOC anomaly detection compared to other unsupervised methods?**

**A**: Isolation Forest excels in SOC environments because it doesn't make assumptions about data distributionâ€”critical when dealing with diverse security logs. Unlike k-means clustering or DBSCAN, it naturally handles high-dimensional, sparse data typical in security logs. Most importantly, it's explicitly designed to find rare events (anomalies), whereas methods like PCA focus on capturing normal variance. The algorithm's efficiency also makes it suitable for real-time threat detection with sub-50ms inference times.

### **Q2: How do you calculate session entropy and what specific attack patterns does it reveal?**

**A**: Session entropy measures the unpredictability of user actions within a time window. We calculate it as `H = -Î£ p(action_i) * log2(p(action_i))` where p(action_i) is the probability of each action type. High entropy might indicate lateral movement (attacker trying multiple access attempts), while suspiciously low entropy could reveal automated tools or scripts. For example, a user who typically shows varied entropy (3.2-4.1 bits) suddenly dropping to 1.8 bits might indicate account compromise with automated tools.

### **Q3: How does the system avoid flagging rare but legitimate behaviors as anomalies?**

**A**: We maintain per-user behavioral baselines rather than global thresholds. Each user's historical entropy patterns and dependency graph structures are tracked, so a night-shift administrator's unusual hours won't trigger alerts if it's consistent with their role. Additionally, SHAP values provide feature attribution, allowing analysts to quickly distinguish between "rare but normal" (like emergency system access) and "rare and suspicious" (like accessing HR systems from a developer account).

### **Q4: How does the model adapt to adversarial evasion tactics where attackers try to mimic normal behavior?**

**A**: The model uses several defensive strategies:

- **Randomized Partitioning**: Makes it difficult for adversaries to craft systematic evasion inputs
- **Behavioral Baselines**: Even if attackers mimic general patterns, they struggle to replicate individual user-specific behaviors tracked in dependency graphs
- **Feature Drift Monitoring**: Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests detect significant changes in input distributions, which may signal adversarial manipulation
- **Multi-dimensional Analysis**: Combining entropy and graph features makes simultaneous evasion across all dimensions extremely difficult

### **Q5: How do you ensure real-time readiness and what are the latency expectations?**

**A**: The system is designed for <50ms inference time per event through several optimizations:

- **Streaming Architecture**: Apache Kafka + Spark MLlib for real-time processing
- **Efficient Data Structures**: Adjacency matrices for dependency graphs rather than full graph databases
- **Batch Inference**: Process multiple events simultaneously when possible
- **Pre-computed Features**: Session entropy and user baselines are updated incrementally rather than recalculated each time

### **Q6: How does weekly retraining with a 30-day rolling window balance model freshness with stability?**

**A**: The 30-day window captures enough behavioral diversity to avoid overfitting to short-term anomalies while staying current with evolving threats. Weekly retraining ensures the model adapts to:

- **New employees** and their establishing behavioral patterns
- **Seasonal changes** in business operations (quarter-end activities, holiday schedules)
- **Infrastructure changes** (new systems, retired applications)
- **Emerging attack techniques** that gradually change normal vs. anomalous boundaries

### **Q7: What specific metrics demonstrate this approach's impact on SOC analyst workload?**

**A**: Key performance indicators include:

- **Alert Volume Reduction**: 60-80% fewer false positive alerts compared to rule-based systems
- **Time to Investigation**: SHAP explanations reduce average investigation time from 15 minutes to 3-5 minutes
- **Detection Coverage**: Identifies 15-25% more true threats missed by signature-based systems
- **Analyst Confidence**: Explainable AI features increase analyst confidence in model recommendations from 40% to 85%

## ðŸ”¹ Section 5: Optimization Tips

### **Model Tuning Strategies**

**Isolation Forest Hyperparameters**:

- **n_estimators**: Start with 100, increase to 200-300 for higher accuracy if latency allows
- **max_samples**: Use 256 for balanced performance, increase for very large datasets
- **contamination**: Set dynamically based on historical anomaly rates (typically 0.01-0.05)

**Feature Engineering Optimization**:

- **Session Window Tuning**: Experiment with 15-minute, 1-hour, and 4-hour windows based on your organization's typical session lengths
- **Entropy Smoothing**: Apply exponential moving averages to reduce noise in entropy calculations
- **Graph Pruning**: Remove low-weight edges in dependency graphs to focus on significant relationships

### **Reducing False Positives**

- **User-Specific Thresholds**: Maintain separate anomaly thresholds for different user roles (admin vs. regular user)
- **Time-Aware Baselines**: Account for day-of-week and hour-of-day patterns in baseline calculations
- **Multi-Stage Filtering**: Require anomalies to persist across multiple time windows before alerting

### **Reducing False Negatives**

- **Ensemble Approaches**: Combine multiple Isolation Forest models trained on different feature subsets
- **Hybrid Thresholding**: Use both statistical and learned thresholds
- **Active Learning**: Incorporate analyst feedback to retrain on missed threats

### **Trade-offs Considerations**

**Complexity vs. Interpretability**:

- More complex dependency graphs improve detection but reduce interpretability
- Balance model complexity with analyst ability to understand and act on alerts

**Real-time vs. Accuracy**:

- Simplified feature sets enable faster inference but may miss subtle anomalies
- Consider tiered detection: fast screening + detailed analysis for high-risk events
