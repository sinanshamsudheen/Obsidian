### Slide 3: Role of ML in SOC

**Challenges with Traditional SOCs:**

- Signature-based tools struggle with unknown threats
    
- High false positives and analyst fatigue
    

**Why Machine Learning:**

- Proactive threat hunting
    
- Real-time anomaly detection
    
- Adaptive to evolving attack patterns

### Slide 4: Anomaly Detection – Problem

- Identify deviations from normal behavior in network/system logs
    
- Crucial for detecting unknown threats
    
- Types: Point, Contextual, and Collective Anomalies

### Slide 5: Anomaly Detection – ML Approaches

|Model|Strengths|Weaknesses|Best For|
|---|---|---|---|
|Isolation Forest|Fast, scalable, works with high-dimensional data|Not ideal for sequential or contextual anomalies|Point anomalies in network logs|
|One-Class SVM|Effective for one-class training, detects novel threats|Sensitive to kernel and parameter settings|Rare anomaly events, user behavior logs|
|Autoencoder|Learns compressed patterns, high anomaly resolution|Requires tuning and training time|High-dimensional time-series, system logs|
|GAN|Excellent at detecting subtle deviations|Hard to train, less interpretable|Rare attack patterns, adversarial threats|

---

### Slide 6: Anomaly Detection – Step-by-Step Approach

1. **Data Collection**: Logs, network traffic, endpoints
    
2. **Preprocessing**: Normalization, outlier treatment
    
3. **Feature Engineering**: Session length, port use, user patterns
    
4. **Model Training**: Split into train/val/test
    
5. **Evaluation**: Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC
    
6. **Deployment**: Real-time inference, integration with SIEM

### Slide 8: Phishing URL Detection – Problem

- URLs mimic legit domains
    
- Use social engineering
    
- Hard to blacklist proactively

### Slide 9: Phishing URL Detection – ML Approaches

| Model               | Strengths                            | Weaknesses                            | Best Features                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Logistic Regression | Simple, fast, interpretable          | Linear, not good for complex patterns | URL length, keyword presence      |
| Random Forest       | High accuracy, handles many features | May overfit, less interpretable       | Domain + WHOIS + lexical patterns |
| CNN                 | Learns local patterns in URLs        | Needs a large dataset                 | Character-level embeddings        |
| LSTM                | Captures long-term dependencies      | Longer training time                  | Sequence modeling of URL tokens   |

### Slide 12: Email Spam Detection – Problem

- Spam wastes time, carries malware/phishing
    
- Modern spam mimics real emails and bypasses filters

### Slide 13: Email Spam Detection – ML Approaches

|Model|Strengths|Weaknesses|Input Format|
|---|---|---|---|
|Naive Bayes|Fast, scalable, good baseline|Assumes word independence|Token frequencies, bag-of-words|
|SVM|High accuracy on high-dimensional data|Kernel and computation intensive|TF-IDF scores|
|CNN|Detects local patterns like keywords or format|May miss global context|Word embeddings, n-grams|
|BERT|Best-in-class NLP model, deep context|Heavy compute requirement|Raw email text, fine-tuned embeddings|

### Slide 14: Spam Detection – Flow

1. **Data Sources**: Enron, SpamAssassin
    
2. **Preprocessing**: Clean HTML, tokenize, lowercase
    
3. **Feature Extraction**: TF-IDF, email header flags
    
4. **Training & Evaluation**
    
5. **Deployment**: Email server integration

### Slide 16: Firewall Optimization

- Use of ML to rank and optimize firewall rules
    
- Reinforcement learning for adaptive decision-making
    
- Features: packet metadata, traffic logs, rule match frequency
    
- Goal: Minimize false negatives, reduce latency, adapt policies
    

---

### Slide 17: Log Parsing with ML

- Logs vary in structure; hard to automate analysis
    
- ML + NLP methods (regex + clustering + BiLSTM-CRF)
    
- Use Case: Tag components (timestamp, IP, action) → structured format
    

---

### Slide 18: Data Leak Prevention

- Use ML to detect confidential or sensitive content (PII, credentials)
    
- Text classification with transformers (BERT, RoBERTa)
    
- Alerts & auto-redaction in emails, chats, uploads
