I have attached the **syllabus screenshots** and **previous-year PYQs** for my subject.  
Each PYQ file has **two sections: Part A (3-mark questions)** and **Part B (8-mark questions)**.  
Treat them **separately** — never categorize a 3-mark question as an 8-mark one or vice versa during analysis.

### 🎯 **Your Task**

Deeply analyze both the **syllabus** and the **PYQs (Parts A and B)** to identify the **most probable or frequently repeated questions** for each of the five modules.

For each module, generate two sections:

1. **PART A (3-mark questions)** – Top 5 most probable short questions.
    
2. **PART B (8-mark questions)** – Top 7 most probable long questions.

### 🧩 **Output Format (Strictly Follow This)**

#### **Module X**

**PART A (3 Marks):**

1. _Question – Topic – Probability (%)_
    
    - **Answer:**
        
        - 4 bullet points each with 10-15 words.
            
        - Simple, easy-to-remember language.
            
        - No long paragraphs.
            
        - Use a **table** whenever the answer involves a comparison.
            

**PART B (8 Marks):**

1. _Question – Topic – Probability (%)_
    
    - **Answer:**
        
        - 6 to 8 clear bullet points, each bullet point should have atleast 15-20 words.
            
        - Write in simple, exam-ready English.
            
        - Include brief examples, diagrams, or notes if needed.
            
        - Use a **table** for comparison questions.

### 🧠 **Guidelines**

- Use **only** the provided syllabus and PYQs — no external sources.
    
- Treat questions with the same meaning (even if reworded) as identical and merge their frequencies.
    
- Estimate **probability (%)** based on frequency over the years, rewording patterns, and module importance.
    
- Sort questions in **descending order of probability** (most likely first).
    
- Every question must have its **answer immediately below it** (no separate list).
    
- Keep formatting clean, modular, and visually easy for study/revision.

### 📋 **Example Structure (Demo Only)**

Module 1:  

PART A (3 Marks):  
1. Define alkalinity and its types – Water Chemistry – 87%  
   - **Answer:**  
     - Alkalinity is the ability of water to neutralize acids.  
     - Caused mainly by hydroxides (OH⁻), carbonates (CO₃²⁻), and bicarbonates (HCO₃⁻).  
     - Expressed as mg/L of CaCO₃ equivalent.  
     - Types: temporary (due to HCO₃⁻) and permanent (due to CO₃²⁻, OH⁻).  

---

PART B (8 Marks):  
1. Explain the ion-exchange process of water softening – Water Treatment – 95%  
   - **Answer:**  
     - Water hardness is caused by the presence of calcium (Ca²⁺) and magnesium (Mg²⁺) ions that react with soap and form insoluble scum.  
     - The ion-exchange process removes these hardness-causing ions by replacing them with sodium (Na⁺) ions using specially prepared resins.  
     - **Resins used:**  
       - *Cation-exchange resin (R–Na):* exchanges Na⁺ for Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺.  
       - *Anion-exchange resin (R–OH):* removes anions such as Cl⁻, SO₄²⁻, and NO₃⁻.  
     - **Reactions involved:**  
       - R–Na + Ca²⁺ → R₂–Ca + 2Na⁺  
       - R–Na + Mg²⁺ → R₂–Mg + 2Na⁺  
     - **Regeneration step:**  
       - After exhaustion, resins are regenerated using concentrated brine (NaCl) solution to restore Na⁺ ions.  
       - R₂–Ca + 2NaCl → 2R–Na + CaCl₂  
     - **Advantages:**  
       - Produces completely soft water suitable for industrial use and boilers.  
       - Removes both temporary and permanent hardness.  
       - Faster, continuous, and more efficient than lime-soda or zeolite processes.  
       - Compact, easy to operate, and requires minimal maintenance.  
     - **Applications:**  
       - Domestic water softeners, power plants, textile industries, and boiler feedwater preparation.  



### 🧾 **Final Output Expectations**

- Cover **all five modules** in order.
    
- For every question, include its **probability (%)**, **topic**, and the **answer below** it.
    
- Keep language **exam-friendly**, **easy to memorize**, and **formatted in bullets or tables**.
    
- Maintain strict distinction between **Part A (3 marks)** and **Part B (8 marks)** during analysis and answer generation.

✅ **Goal:**  
Produce a single, clean, and complete study document containing the **most probable exam questions** (with answers) for each module — ready for direct revision.
