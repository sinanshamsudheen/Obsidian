I have attached the **syllabus screenshots** and **previous-year PYQs** for my subject.  
Each PYQ file has **two sections: Part A (3-mark questions)** and **Part B (8-mark questions)**.  
Treat them **separately** — never categorize a 3-mark question as an 8-mark one or vice versa during analysis.

### 🎯 **Your Task**

Deeply analyze both the **syllabus** and the **PYQs (Parts A and B)** to identify the **most probable or frequently repeated questions** for each of the five modules.

For each module, generate two sections:

1. **PART A (3-mark questions)** – Top 5 most probable short questions.
    
2. **PART B (8-mark questions)** – Top 7 most probable long questions.

### 🧩 **Output Format (Strictly Follow This)**

#### **Module X**

**PART A (3 Marks):**

1. _Question – Topic – Probability (%)_
    
    - **Answer:**
        
        - 4 concise bullet points only.
            
        - Simple, easy-to-remember language.
            
        - No long paragraphs.
            
        - Use a **table** whenever the answer involves a comparison.
            

**PART B (8 Marks):**

1. _Question – Topic – Probability (%)_
    
    - **Answer:**
        
        - 6 to 8 clear bullet points.
            
        - Write in simple, exam-ready English.
            
        - Include brief examples, diagrams, or notes if needed.
            
        - Use a **table** for comparison questions.

### 🧠 **Guidelines**

- Use **only** the provided syllabus and PYQs — no external sources.
    
- Treat questions with the same meaning (even if reworded) as identical and merge their frequencies.
    
- Estimate **probability (%)** based on frequency over the years, rewording patterns, and module importance.
    
- Sort questions in **descending order of probability** (most likely first).
    
- Every question must have its **answer immediately below it** (no separate list).
    
- Keep formatting clean, modular, and visually easy for study/revision.

### 📋 **Example Structure (Demo Only)**

Module 1:

PART A:
1. Define alkalinity and its types – Water Chemistry – 87%
   - Answer:
     - Alkalinity is the capacity to neutralize acids.
     - Caused by hydroxide, carbonate and bicarbonate ions.
     - Expressed in mg/L as CaCO₃.
     - Temporary or permanent based on source.

PART B:
1. Explain ion-exchange process of water softening – Water Treatment – 95%
   - Answer:
     - Hardness due to Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺ ions.
     - Ion-exchange resin replaces Ca²⁺/Mg²⁺ with Na⁺.
     - Includes regeneration with brine solution.
     - Produces soft water for industrial use.
     - Removes both temporary and permanent hardness.
     - Faster and more efficient than lime-soda method.

### 🧾 **Final Output Expectations**

- Cover **all five modules** in order.
    
- For every question, include its **probability (%)**, **topic**, and the **answer below** it.
    
- Keep language **exam-friendly**, **easy to memorize**, and **formatted in bullets or tables**.
    
- Maintain strict distinction between **Part A (3 marks)** and **Part B (8 marks)** during analysis and answer generation.

✅ **Goal:**  
Produce a single, clean, and complete study document containing the **most probable exam questions** (with answers) for each module — ready for direct revision.
