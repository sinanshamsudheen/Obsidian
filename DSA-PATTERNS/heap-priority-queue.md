## ðŸ§  Heap / Priority Queue

**Heap / Priority Queue** is a data structure that maintains elements in a partially ordered way, allowing efficient access to the minimum or maximum element.

â€¢ Two types: Min-heap (smallest element at root) and Max-heap (largest element at root)
â€¢ Key operations: insert O(log n), extract-min/max O(log n), peek O(1)
â€¢ Useful for problems involving "top K", "Kth largest/smallest", and scheduling
â€¢ Python's `heapq` module provides min-heap implementation

**Related:** [[Heap]] [[Tree]] [[Priority Queue]]

What is the Heap / Priority Queue pattern? ::

â€¢ Data structure maintaining partial order with efficient min/max access (insert/extract O(log n), peek O(1))
â€¢ Two types: min-heap (smallest at root) and max-heap (largest at root)
â€¢ Used for "top K", "Kth largest/smallest", scheduling, and streaming data problems
