## ðŸ§  Floyd-Warshall / All-Pairs Shortest Path

**Floyd-Warshall** finds shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph, handling negative edges but not negative cycles.

â€¢ Dynamic programming approach that considers each vertex as intermediate point
â€¢ Works with negative edge weights but detects negative cycles
â€¢ Time complexity: O(VÂ³), Space complexity: O(VÂ²)
â€¢ Useful for dense graphs and when you need all-pairs shortest paths

**Related:** [[Graph]] [[Dynamic Programming]] [[Shortest Path]] [[Matrix]]

What is the Floyd-Warshall / All-Pairs Shortest Path pattern? ::

â€¢ Dynamic programming algorithm finding shortest paths between all vertex pairs in O(VÂ³) time
â€¢ Handles negative edges but detects negative cycles, considers each vertex as intermediate point
â€¢ Used for dense graphs, transitive closure, and when all-pairs shortest paths are needed
