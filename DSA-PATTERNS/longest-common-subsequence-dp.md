## ðŸ§  Longest Common Subsequence (DP)

**Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)** finds the longest subsequence common to two or more sequences, where subsequence maintains relative order but elements need not be consecutive.

â€¢ Subsequence preserves order but allows gaps (unlike substring)
â€¢ Uses 2D DP table where dp[i][j] = LCS length of first i chars of string1 and first j chars of string2
â€¢ Time complexity: O(m Ã— n), Space: O(m Ã— n) or O(min(m,n)) optimized
â€¢ Foundation for edit distance, diff algorithms, and sequence alignment

**Related:** [[Dynamic Programming]] [[String]] [[Sequence]]

What is the Longest Common Subsequence (DP) pattern? ::

â€¢ Finds longest subsequence common to sequences, preserving order but allowing gaps  
â€¢ Uses 2D DP table with O(mÃ—n) time, comparing characters and taking max of previous states
â€¢ Foundation for edit distance, sequence alignment, and string similarity problems
