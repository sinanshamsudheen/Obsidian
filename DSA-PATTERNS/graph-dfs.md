## ðŸ§  Graph DFS

**Graph DFS (Depth-First Search)** explores a graph by going as deep as possible along each branch before backtracking.

â€¢ Uses recursion (implicit stack) or explicit stack for traversal
â€¢ Explores one path completely before trying alternative paths
â€¢ Useful for cycle detection, topological sorting, and strongly connected components
â€¢ Time complexity: O(V + E), Space complexity: O(V) where V = vertices, E = edges

**Related:** [[Graph]] [[Stack]] [[DFS]] [[Recursion]]

## ðŸ§  Flashcard (for spaced repetition)

What is the Graph DFS pattern? :: â€¢ Explores graph by going deep along each branch before backtracking using recursion or stack â€¢ Time O(V + E), Space O(V); used for cycle detection, topological sorting, and path finding â€¢ Goes deep first unlike BFS which explores level by level [[graph-dfs]]
