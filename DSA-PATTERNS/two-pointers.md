## ðŸ§  Two Pointers

The **Two Pointers** pattern uses two pointers to traverse a data structure, often moving towards each other or in the same direction.

â€¢ Helps solve problems involving pairs, triplets, or specific relationships between elements
â€¢ Common approaches: opposite ends moving inward, or both starting from beginning at different speeds
â€¢ Useful for sorted arrays, palindromes, and finding pairs with target sums
â€¢ Reduces time complexity from O(nÂ²) to O(n) for many problems

**Related:** [[Array]] [[String]]

## ðŸ’¡ Python Code Snippet

```python
def two_sum_sorted(arr, target):
    """
    Two pointers from opposite ends - find pair that sums to target
    Works on sorted arrays
    """
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    
    while left < right:
        current_sum = arr[left] + arr[right]
        
        if current_sum == target:
            return [left, right]  # Found the pair
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1  # Need larger sum
        else:
            right -= 1  # Need smaller sum
    
    return []  # No pair found

def is_palindrome(s):
    """
    Two pointers moving towards center - check if string is palindrome
    """
    # Clean the string: keep only alphanumeric characters
    cleaned = ''.join(char.lower() for char in s if char.isalnum())
    
    left, right = 0, len(cleaned) - 1
    
    while left < right:
        if cleaned[left] != cleaned[right]:
            return False
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    
    return True

def remove_duplicates(arr):
    """
    Two pointers same direction - remove duplicates in-place
    """
    if not arr:
        return 0
    
    # slow pointer: position to place next unique element
    # fast pointer: explores the array
    slow = 0
    
    for fast in range(1, len(arr)):
        if arr[fast] != arr[slow]:
            slow += 1
            arr[slow] = arr[fast]
    
    return slow + 1  # length of array without duplicates
```

## ðŸ§  Flashcard (for spaced repetition)

What is the Two Pointers pattern? ::

â€¢ Uses two pointers to traverse data structure, either from opposite ends or same direction
â€¢ Reduces time complexity from O(nÂ²) to O(n) for problems involving pairs or relationships
â€¢ Common for sorted arrays, palindromes, and finding target sums or removing duplicates
