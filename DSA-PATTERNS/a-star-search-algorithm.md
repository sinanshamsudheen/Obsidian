## ðŸ§  A* Search Algorithm

**A* Search Algorithm** is an informed search algorithm that finds the shortest path by using heuristics to guide the search towards the goal more efficiently than Dijkstra's algorithm.

â€¢ Combines actual cost from start (g-score) with heuristic estimate to goal (h-score)
â€¢ Uses f-score = g-score + h-score to prioritize nodes in exploration
â€¢ Guarantees optimal solution if heuristic is admissible (never overestimates)
â€¢ More efficient than Dijkstra when good heuristic is available

**Related:** [[Graph]] [[Heap]] [[Shortest Path]] [[Heuristic]] [[Search]]

## ðŸ§  Flashcard (for spaced repetition)

What is the A* Search Algorithm pattern? :: â€¢ Informed search using f-score = g-score + h-score where g=actual cost, h=heuristic estimate â€¢ More efficient than Dijkstra when good admissible heuristic available, guarantees optimal solution â€¢ Applied to pathfinding, puzzle solving, and optimization problems with spatial or domain knowledge [[a-star-search-algorithm]]
