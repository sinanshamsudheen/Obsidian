## ðŸ§  Cyclic Sort

The **Cyclic Sort** pattern is used when dealing with arrays containing numbers in a given range, typically from 1 to n.

â€¢ Places each number at its correct index (number 1 goes to index 0, number 2 to index 1, etc.)
â€¢ Achieves O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity
â€¢ Useful for finding missing numbers, duplicates, or first missing positive
â€¢ Works by swapping elements until each number is in its correct position

## ðŸ§  Flashcard (for spaced repetition)

What is the Cyclic Sort pattern? ::

â€¢ Places each number at its correct index in array containing numbers from 1 to n
â€¢ Achieves O(n) time and O(1) space by swapping elements to correct positions  
â€¢ Used for finding missing numbers, duplicates, or first missing positive in arrays
