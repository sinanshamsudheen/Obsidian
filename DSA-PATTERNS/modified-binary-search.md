## ðŸ§  Modified Binary Search

**Modified Binary Search** adapts the binary search technique for problems beyond simple sorted array searches.

â€¢ Applies binary search to problems where we can eliminate half the search space based on some condition
â€¢ Works on rotated arrays, 2D matrices, or when searching for a condition rather than exact value
â€¢ Still maintains O(log n) time complexity by halving search space
â€¢ Key is identifying the condition that allows us to eliminate half the possibilities

**Related:** [[Array]] [[Binary Search]] [[Search Space]]

## ðŸ§  Flashcard (for spaced repetition)

What is the Modified Binary Search pattern? ::

â€¢ Adapts binary search for problems beyond simple sorted array searches (rotated arrays, 2D matrices, optimization)
â€¢ Maintains O(log n) by eliminating half the search space based on conditions
â€¢ Key is identifying the condition that allows eliminating half the possibilities
