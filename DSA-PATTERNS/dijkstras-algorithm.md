## ðŸ§  Dijkstra's Algorithm

**Dijkstra's Algorithm** finds the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph with non-negative edge weights.

â€¢ Greedy algorithm that always selects the unvisited vertex with minimum distance
â€¢ Uses priority queue (min-heap) for efficient vertex selection
â€¢ Time complexity: O((V + E) log V), Space complexity: O(V)
â€¢ Cannot handle negative edge weights but guarantees optimal solutions for non-negative weights

**Related:** [[Graph]] [[Heap]] [[Shortest Path]] [[Greedy]]
