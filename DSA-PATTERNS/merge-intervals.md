## ðŸ§  Merge Intervals

The **Merge Intervals** pattern deals with problems involving overlapping intervals that need to be merged, inserted, or manipulated.

â€¢ Start by sorting intervals based on start time
â€¢ Iterate through sorted intervals and merge overlapping ones
â€¢ Two intervals overlap if start of one is â‰¤ end of another
â€¢ Useful for scheduling problems, calendar conflicts, and range operations

**Related:** [[Array]] [[Sorting]]

What is the Merge Intervals pattern? :: â€¢ Handles problems with overlapping intervals by first sorting intervals by start time â€¢ Merges overlapping intervals where start of one â‰¤ end of another â€¢ Common for scheduling problems, calendar conflicts, and range operations [[merge-intervals]]
