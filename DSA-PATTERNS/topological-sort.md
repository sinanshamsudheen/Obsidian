## ðŸ§  Topological Sort

**Topological Sort** arranges vertices of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) in a linear order where every directed edge goes from earlier to later in the ordering.

â€¢ Works only on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)
â€¢ Two main approaches: DFS-based (using recursion stack) and BFS-based (Kahn's algorithm)
â€¢ Useful for scheduling tasks, course prerequisites, and dependency resolution
â€¢ Time complexity: O(V + E), Space complexity: O(V)

**Related:** [[Graph]] [[DFS]] [[BFS]] [[DAG]]

What is the Topological Sort pattern? ::

â€¢ Arranges vertices of directed acyclic graph in linear order where edges go from earlier to later vertices
â€¢ Two approaches: DFS-based (recursion stack) and BFS-based (Kahn's algorithm using in-degrees)
â€¢ Used for task scheduling, course prerequisites, and dependency resolution problems
