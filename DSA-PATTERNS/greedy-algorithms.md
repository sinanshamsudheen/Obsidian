## ðŸ§  Greedy Algorithms

**Greedy Algorithms** make locally optimal choices at each step with the hope of achieving a globally optimal solution.

â€¢ Makes the best immediate choice without considering future consequences
â€¢ Works when local optimal choices lead to global optimal solution
â€¢ Generally easier to implement than dynamic programming but harder to prove correctness
â€¢ Common applications: scheduling, interval problems, and optimization tasks

**Related:** [[Optimization]] [[Sorting]] [[Scheduling]]

What is the Greedy Algorithms pattern? ::

â€¢ Makes locally optimal choices at each step hoping to achieve globally optimal solution
â€¢ Works when local optimal choices lead to global optimum, often requiring proof of correctness
â€¢ Applied to scheduling, interval problems, optimization tasks, and resource allocation problems
