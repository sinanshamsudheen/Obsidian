## ðŸ§  Fast & Slow Pointers

The **Fast & Slow Pointers** pattern (also called Floyd's Cycle Detection) uses two pointers moving at different speeds through a data structure.

â€¢ Fast pointer moves 2 steps, slow pointer moves 1 step at a time
â€¢ Primarily used for detecting cycles in linked lists
â€¢ Can find the middle of a linked list, detect loops, and find loop start points
â€¢ Works because if there's a cycle, fast pointer will eventually catch up to slow pointer

**Related:** [[Linked List]]

```python
class ListNode:

    if not head or not head.next:

    # Move slow by 1, fast by 2
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next

## ðŸ§  Flashcard (for spaced repetition)

What is the Fast & Slow Pointers pattern? :: â€¢ Uses two pointers moving at different speeds (fast: 2 steps, slow: 1 step) through data structure â€¢ Primarily for cycle detection in linked lists using Floyd's algorithm â€¢ When cycle exists, fast pointer eventually catches up to slow pointer [[fast-and-slow-pointers]]
