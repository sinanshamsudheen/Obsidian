## ðŸ§  Unbounded Knapsack (DP)

**Unbounded Knapsack** allows using each item unlimited times, unlike 0/1 knapsack where each item can be used at most once.

â€¢ Items can be selected multiple times (unlimited supply)
â€¢ Goal is to maximize value within weight/capacity constraints  
â€¢ Uses 1D DP array, processing in forward direction
â€¢ Time complexity: O(n Ã— W), Space: O(W)

**Related:** [[Dynamic Programming]] [[Array]] [[Optimization]]

What is the Unbounded Knapsack (DP) pattern? :: â€¢ Items can be selected multiple times (unlimited supply) to maximize value within constraints â€¢ Uses 1D DP array processing in forward direction with O(nÃ—W) time complexity â€¢ Applied to coin change, perfect squares, and problems allowing repeated use of elements [[unbounded-knapsack-dp]]
