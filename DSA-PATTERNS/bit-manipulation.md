## ðŸ§  Bit Manipulation

**Bit Manipulation** uses bitwise operations to solve problems efficiently by working directly with binary representations.

â€¢ Common operations: AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), NOT (~), left shift (<<), right shift (>>)
â€¢ XOR properties: a^a = 0, a^0 = a, XOR is commutative and associative
â€¢ Useful for finding unique numbers, checking power of 2, and optimization problems
â€¢ Often provides O(1) space solutions and can be faster than arithmetic operations

**Related:** [[Binary]] [[Mathematics]] [[Optimization]]

What is the Bit Manipulation pattern? ::

â€¢ Uses bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR, shifts) to solve problems efficiently with binary representations  
â€¢ Key XOR properties: a^a=0, a^0=a; useful for finding unique numbers and duplicates
â€¢ Often provides O(1) space solutions and can be faster than arithmetic operations
