## ðŸ§  Sliding Window

The **Sliding Window** pattern involves creating a window of fixed or variable size that slides through a data structure (usually an array or string). 

â€¢ Instead of using nested loops, we maintain a window and adjust its boundaries
â€¢ Useful for problems involving contiguous subarrays or substrings
â€¢ Helps reduce time complexity from O(nÂ²) to O(n)
â€¢ Two main types: fixed-size window and variable-size window

**Related:** [[Array]] [[String]]

```python
def sliding_window_fixed(arr, k):
    """

    if len(arr) < k:
        return None

    window_sum = sum(arr[:k])

    # Slide the window: remove leftmost, add rightmost
    for i in range(k, len(arr)):
        window_sum = window_sum - arr[i - k] + arr[i]
        max_sum = max(max_sum, window_sum)
    
    return max_sum

        # Shrink window if we exceed k distinct characters
        while len(char_count) > k:

## ðŸ§  Flashcard (for spaced repetition)

What is the Sliding Window pattern? ::

â€¢ A technique that maintains a window (subarray/substring) that slides through data to avoid nested loops
â€¢ Reduces time complexity from O(nÂ²) to O(n) for contiguous subarray/substring problems
â€¢ Two types: fixed-size (constant window) and variable-size (expand/shrink based on conditions)
