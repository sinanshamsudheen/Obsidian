## ðŸ§  Binary Search

**Binary Search** efficiently finds a target value in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search space in half.

â€¢ Works only on sorted data structures
â€¢ Eliminates half of remaining elements in each iteration
â€¢ Time complexity: O(log n), Space complexity: O(1) for iterative approach
â€¢ Key insight: compare middle element with target to decide which half to search

**Related:** [[Array]] [[Sorting]] [[Divide and Conquer]]

What is the Binary Search pattern? :: â€¢ Efficiently finds target in sorted array by repeatedly dividing search space in half â€¢ O(log n) time complexity by eliminating half of elements each iteration â€¢ Compares middle element with target to decide which half to search next [[binary-search]]
