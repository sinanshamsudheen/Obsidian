## ðŸ§  In-place Reversal of Linked List

The **In-place Reversal of Linked List** pattern reverses parts or all of a linked list without using extra space.

â€¢ Uses three pointers: previous, current, and next to reverse links
â€¢ Can reverse entire list or specific portions (between two positions)
â€¢ Achieves O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity
â€¢ Key technique is to reverse the direction of pointers while traversing

**Related:** [[Linked List]]

## ðŸ§  Flashcard (for spaced repetition)

What is the In-place Reversal of Linked List pattern? ::

â€¢ Reverses linked list or portions of it using three pointers (prev, current, next) without extra space
â€¢ Achieves O(n) time and O(1) space by reversing pointer directions while traversing
â€¢ Used for reversing entire lists, specific sections, or groups of nodes in linked lists
