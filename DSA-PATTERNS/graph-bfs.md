## ðŸ§  Graph BFS

**Graph BFS (Breadth-First Search)** explores a graph level by level, visiting all neighbors before moving to the next level.

â€¢ Uses a queue to keep track of nodes to visit next
â€¢ Explores nodes in order of their distance from the start node
â€¢ Guarantees shortest path in unweighted graphs
â€¢ Time complexity: O(V + E), Space complexity: O(V) where V = vertices, E = edges

**Related:** [[Graph]] [[Queue]] [[BFS]] [[Shortest Path]]
