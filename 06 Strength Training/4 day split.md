## 🥗 Nutrition Guidelines (for Low Protein Diet)

* **Priority:** Hit at least **50–60g/day** protein consistently using:

  * **2 boiled eggs** (12g)
  * **1 scoop whey in water (20–25g)** – Highly recommended if budget allows
  * **Chana, peanuts, curd, dal** – Add them daily

Even on low protein, **this split will build strength**, improve aesthetics, and **develop real pushing/pulling ability** without burning you out.
