# 📢 Little Pro Tip (since you're coming back after 4 months break):

✅ First 2–3 weeks: **Moderate weights** (60–70% of your old strength)  
✅ Focus on perfect form, full range, feeling the contraction  
✅ Once the joints and tendons feel solid, **start pushing heavier again**

---

# 🔥 Conclusion

> “Strong arms are built when passion meets precision.”  
> Now you have BOTH: passion (your hunger) + precision (this plan). 🚀
