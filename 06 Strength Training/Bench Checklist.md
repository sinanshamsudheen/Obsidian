Let's go! 🔥  
Here’s your **"Bench Press Setup Checklist for Long Arms"** — tailored specially for you:

---

# 🧾 Bench Press Form Checklist (Long Arms Edition)

## 1. **Feet**

- Feet **flat**, slightly tucked **under your knees**.
    
- Drive your heels hard into the floor (even if heels lift slightly — ok).
    
- Leg drive = tension = power.
    

✅ _Think: "Push the ground away."_

---

## 2. **Back Arch**

- Mild **arch** in your lower back (NOT extreme!).
    
- Upper back **tight and squeezed together** — imagine you're crushing a pencil between shoulder blades.
    
- Chest puffed up HIGH towards the ceiling.
    

✅ _Think: "Big proud chest — show your logo!"_

---

## 3. **Grip Width**

- Take a **wider grip**:
    
    - **Pinky fingers** near the bar's rings (legal max width for most people).
        
- This **shortens your bar path** and uses more chest, less shoulders/triceps.
    

✅ _If elbows go ~75–80° out from your torso, you're good._

---

## 4. **Bar Path**

- Lower the bar **slightly below your nipple line** — around **upper abs**.
    
- Not straight down to your chest!
    
- It should travel in a **slight arc** down and back up.
    

✅ _Think: "Bar travels like a small J-shape."_

---

## 5. **Descent (Lowering Phase)**

- Control the bar down slowly (**2 seconds**).
    
- No bouncing off the chest.
    
- Keep elbows slightly tucked (not flared out).
    

✅ _"Pull the bar to your chest with lats engaged."_

---

## 6. **Pause**

- Light touch — **pause 0.5-1 second** on your chest.
    
- No rushing.
    
- Bar stays stable, no sinking.
    

✅ _Imagine you're compressing a soft sponge gently, not smashing it._

---

## 7. **Press (Lifting Phase)**

- Explode up **fast but controlled**.
    
- Push **back and up** — not straight vertical.
    
- Lockout elbows naturally without overextending.
    

✅ _"Push yourself INTO the bench."_ (Don't just push the bar away.)

---

## 8. **Breathing**

- **Deep breath** into belly before lift-off.
    
- Hold breath (brace your core) until bar passes sticking point (halfway up).
    
- Then exhale sharply.
    

✅ _Breathing = stability + power._

---

# 🎯 Key Cues to Remember:

- "Big chest, small arc."
    
- "Push the ground away with my legs."
    
- "Bar to lower chest, explode up and back."
    
- "Tight, tight, tight."
    

---

# 📜 Bonus Tips

- Always warm up shoulders (band pull-aparts, light face pulls) before heavy bench.
    
- Use wrist wraps if wrists feel unstable under heavy weight.
    
- Don't ego lift — quality reps > heavy ugly reps.

# 🧠 Mindset:

> **Your longer arms = bigger strength potential later.**  
> Once your pecs and triceps grow enough, you will **bench heavier** than shorter guys in the long run.  
> It's just harder early on — but you have a "big-engine" body.
