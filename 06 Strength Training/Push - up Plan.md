# 🧾 Daily Push-Up Progression Routine (Beginner-Friendly)

## 🌟 Warmup (2 minutes)

- **Arm Circles** (forward + backward): 20 sec each
    
- **Shoulder Taps** (slowly, in a high plank): 20 reps
    
- **Cat-Cow Stretch** (for shoulder blades): 30 sec
    
- **Scapular Push-Ups** (tiny retractions without bending elbows): 15 reps
    

✅ _Goal: Warm up shoulder joints + activate scapula control._

---

## 🏋️‍♂️ Main Push-Up Work (7–8 minutes)

### A. **Incline Push-Ups** (3 sets)

- Hands on bench, table, or sturdy surface.
    
- 10–12 reps per set.
    
- Focus: **Slow Lowering** (take 3 seconds to lower yourself down).
    

💬 _If you can already do 10 easily, reduce the incline or switch to regular push-ups._

---

### B. **Negative Push-Ups** (2–3 sets)

- Start in full push-up position.
    
- Lower yourself **VERY slowly** for **5–6 seconds**.
    
- Rest your knees down, reset, repeat.
    

➡️ **3–5 reps per set**  
**_Super important for building strength._**

---

### C. **Knee Push-Ups (Assistance if needed)** (Optional)

- Drop to knees if fatigued and perform **regular push-ups from knees**.
    
- **8–10 reps** — focus on pushing through your palms, not your fingers.
    

✅ _Use this only to complete your sets if you’re too exhausted._

---

## 🌬 Breathing

- **Inhale** as you lower your body (control).
    
- **Exhale** explosively when you push up.
    

_Breath = Stability = More Power._

- **Brace your core** — imagine planking during every rep.
