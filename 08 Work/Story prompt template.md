Implementation Guidelines:

- Keep changes minimal, clean, and consistent with the existing codebase.
- Use existing files, functions, and components — don’t create new ones unless absolutely necessary.
- Do not modify unrelated files.
- Fix issues at the source (e.g., queries/service layer) rather than patching in the UI.
- Add/adjust unit or integration tests that reproduce the issue and confirm the expected outcome.
- Ensure performance, permissions, and data correctness are maintained.
- Update any relevant docs or notes if user-visible behavior changes.
