- Implemented logic to query database for different activity types (calls, feedback, service records)
- Added priority-based sorting to ensure most important activities are displayed first
- Implemented fallback activities for cases with insufficient data
- Created Pydantic schema models in [activity.py](vscode-file://vscode-app/usr/share/code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-browser/workbench/workbench.html) to define data structures
- Added API endpoint at `/analytics/recent-activities` in [analytics.py](vscode-file://vscode-app/usr/share/code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-browser/workbench/workbench.html)
- Created cron job script [generate_daily_activities.py](vscode-file://vscode-app/usr/share/code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-browser/workbench/workbench.html) for daily activity generation

#### Client-Side Implementation

- Created API client in [activities.ts](vscode-file://vscode-app/usr/share/code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-browser/workbench/workbench.html) for fetching activities from server
- Added React Query hook in [activities.ts](vscode-file://vscode-app/usr/share/code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-browser/workbench/workbench.html) for data fetching with caching
- Developed [RecentActivities](vscode-file://vscode-app/usr/share/code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-browser/workbench/workbench.html) component in [RecentActivities.tsx](vscode-file://vscode-app/usr/share/code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-browser/workbench/workbench.html):
    - Implemented loading state with skeletons
    - Added error handling with user-friendly messages
    - Created visually distinct activity items with appropriate icons and colors based on type
- Integrated the component into the Dashboard page ([Dashboard.tsx](vscode-file://vscode-app/usr/share/code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-browser/workbench/workbench.html))

### 2. PDF Export Fixes

- Investigated issues with PDF export functionality in [pdfExport.ts](vscode-file://vscode-app/usr/share/code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-browser/workbench/workbench.html)
- Initially attempted to fix [html2canvas](vscode-file://vscode-app/usr/share/code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-browser/workbench/workbench.html) import issues using dynamic import pattern
- Reverted changes back to direct import after determining it wasn't the best approach

## Implementation Details

### Activity Types

The system generates the following activity types:

1. **Mandatory Activities** (always shown):
    
    - "Ready for Call" counts (priority 1)
    - "Missed/Failed" calls (priority 2)
2. **Conditional Activities** (shown if data exists):
    
    - New promoters (NPS ≥ 9)
    - New detractors (NPS ≤ 5)
    - Call feedback
    - Service records
3. **Fallback Activities** (shown if fewer than 5 actual activities):
    
    - DMS Sync status
    - Weekly Report availability
    - System Health status

### Notes and Considerations

1. **ChatGPT Integration Missing**
    
    - Current implementation uses templated descriptions rather than AI-generated summaries
    - To meet acceptance criteria fully, we should integrate ChatGPT API for dynamic activity summaries
2. **Cron Job Setup Required**
    
    - Script for daily activity generation is complete
    - Need to set up actual cron job on the server with appropriate schedule
    - Suggested schedule: run daily at midnight (0 0 * * *)
3. **Testing Notes**
    
    - Test activities generation with both real and minimal data to verify fallback behavior
    - Verify date filtering works correctly when selecting different dates
    - Check edge cases for activities with zero counts
4. **Future Enhancements**
    
    - Add pagination or scrolling for viewing activities from earlier days
    - Consider adding user interaction capabilities (e.g., click to see related records)
    - Implement proper date formatting for different locales

## Acceptance Criteria Status

✅ System generates exactly 5 activity items per organization per day  
✅ Activities are visible in the "Recent Activity" section of the dashboard  
✅ Last 2 activities summarize "Ready for Call" and "Missed/Failed Calls" counts  
✅ Fallback messages are shown when there is insufficient data  
❌ Top 3 activities using ChatGPT summarization (not implemented)

## Next Steps

1. Integrate ChatGPT API for dynamic activity summarization
2. Set up the daily cron job for activity generation
3. Add comprehensive unit tests for the activity service
4. Consider adding user preferences for which activity types are most relevant

## 2. Technical Architecture Overview

  

### Existing Infrastructure

```

Frontend (React/TypeScript)

├── RecentActivities Component

├── Dashboard Integration

└── Real-time Activity Display

  

Backend (FastAPI/Python)

├── ActivityService (Core Logic)

├── OpenAIService (AI Integration)

├── Database Models (SQLAlchemy)

└── API Endpoints

```

  

### Database Models Utilized

- **Call**: Call records with status, NPS scores, feedback

- **ServiceRecord**: Service booking and completion data

- **CallFeedback**: Customer feedback and sentiment analysis

- **Organization**: Company context and metadata

  

---

  

## 3. Implementation Strategy & Design Decisions

  

### 3.1 Architecture Decision: Extend vs Create New

**Decision Made**: Extend existing `OpenAIService` instead of creating new files

  

**Rationale**:

// API client function

export const fetchRecentActivities = async (

organizationId: string,

limit: number = 5,

dateFor?: string

): Promise<ActivityResponse[]> => {

const response = await apiClient.get(`/analytics/recent-activities`, {

params: { limit, date_for: dateFor }

});

return response.data;

};

  

// React Query hook

export const useRecentActivities = (

organizationId: string,

limit: number = 5,

dateFor?: string

) => {

return useQuery({

queryKey: ['recent-activities', organizationId, limit, dateFor],

queryFn: () => fetchRecentActivities(organizationId, limit, dateFor),

staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes

cacheTime: 10 * 60 * 1000, // 10 minutes

});

};

```

**Complete React component implementation**:

  

**Key Features**:

1. **Loading States**: Skeleton components during data fetch

2. **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages with retry options

3. **Activity Visualization**: Distinct icons and colors for each activity type

4. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layout with proper spacing

5. **Real-time Updates**: Automatic refresh with React Query caching

  

```typescript

const RecentActivities: React.FC = () => {

const { data: activities, isLoading, error, refetch } = useRecentActivities(

organizationId,

5

);

  

// Implementation with loading skeletons, error handling, and activity display

};

```

  

#### Dashboard Integration (`/client/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`)

**Integrated into main dashboard**:

- Added RecentActivities component to dashboard layout

- Proper positioning within dashboard grid system

- Responsive design considerations

  

### 4.3 Activity Types Implementation

  

#### Mandatory Activities (Always Displayed)

1. **"Ready for Call"** (Priority 1):

```python

ready_calls_query = select(func.count(Call.id)).where(

and_(

Call.organization_id == organization_id,

Call.status == "Ready",

Call.created_at >= start_datetime,

Call.created_at <= end_datetime

)

)

```

  

2. **"Missed/Failed Calls"** (Priority 2):

```python

missed_calls_query = select(func.count(Call.id)).where(

and_(

Call.organization_id == organization_id,

Call.status.in_(["Missed", "Failed"]),

Call.created_at >= start_datetime,

Call.created_at <= end_datetime

)

)

```

  

#### Conditional Activities (Data-Dependent)

3. **Promoters** (NPS ≥ 9): Database queries for high-satisfaction customers

4. **Detractors** (NPS ≤ 5): Database queries for low-satisfaction customers

5. **Call Feedback**: Analysis of feedback records

6. **Service Records**: Tracking of service completions

  

#### Fallback Activities (Insufficient Data)
